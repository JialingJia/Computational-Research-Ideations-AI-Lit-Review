## Pipeline & Infrastructure

Monthly updates to this review are run by **Claude (Anthropic)** — an AI assistant that
discovers new papers, applies the CST taxonomy, and integrates them into the review prose.
Each month's specific additions are documented in the sections below alongside community
contributions. Powered by [claude.ai](https://claude.ai).

  *(Run date: 2026-03-26)*

- **Houji** (@JialingJia) — Requested prose edit in §Scaffolding Human Cognition: "IdeaSynth also belongs to the second type, as it directly generates research problems, synthesize literature." *(2026-03-25)*
- **Houji** (@JialingJia) — Requested prose edit in §Scaffolding Human Cognition: "More accurately, this idea facets only represent different parts of the idea, such as problem statement, research study, instead of criteria facet to evaluate the idea." *(2026-03-25)*
- **Houji** (@JialingJia) — Requested prose edit in §Scaffolding Human Cognition: "The study does not evaluate authorship of the co-created ideas." *(2026-03-25)*

### March 2026 (Revision 2: 2026-03-26)

- **Claude (Anthropic)** — Reclassified IdeaSynth as Type 1 + Type 2 (Hybrid); moved its discussion from §Scaffolding Human Cognition to §Hybrid Systems: Co-Creation Across the Human-AI Boundary. Updated `data_filtered.js` entry accordingly.
  *(Run date: 2026-03-26)*

### March 2026 (Framework Update: 2026-03-28)

- **Claude (Anthropic)** — Major framework update based on Jialingjia's Section 2.2 dissertation framework ("The Design Spectrum of Computational Research Ideation"):
  - Added 16 papers to the database (f58–f73): BACON, DENDRAL, KEKADA, EURISKO (expert systems era); SciAgents, The AI Scientist, Agent Laboratory, AutoDiscovery, Popper/Krenn et al., LLM-SR (LLM agent era); CiteRead, CiteSee, ComLittee, Relatedly, Threddy, Passage (preparatory scaffolding tools).
  - Recategorized SearchIdea (f46): added Analysis & Sensemaking stage and updated `core_contributions` to reflect its dual preparatory-generative role per §2.2.2.1–2.2.2.2.
  - Recategorized AI Co-Scientist (f51): cleared `research_stages` to reflect AI Automation paradigm (researcher as downstream consumer).
  - Rewrote `literature_review.md` in full to align with the AI Automation vs. Mixed-Initiative primary axis and the preparatory vs. generative sub-distinction within mixed-initiative tools.
  - Added revised `cst-categorizer/SKILL.md` and `research-ideation-stages/SKILL.md` to `CST_tool_review/skills/` reflecting the new framework, Shneiderman (2020) emulation/application goals, and Horvitz (1999) mixed-initiative origins.
  - Updated `cst-monthly-pipeline/SKILL.md` to reference the new dual-paradigm structure in categorization steps.
  *(Run date: 2026-03-28)*

- **Houji** (@JialingJia) — Contributed Section 2.2 dissertation framework ("The Design Spectrum of Computational Research Ideation") as the organizing schema for the review. Framework distinguishes AI Automation (emulation goal, Shneiderman 2020) from Mixed-Initiative tools (application goal, Horvitz 1999), and within the latter distinguishes Preparatory Scaffolding from Generative Support. *(2026-03-28)*
